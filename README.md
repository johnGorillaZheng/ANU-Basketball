## 1. Value delivered to client
So far, we have gathered all user requirements from our client, and finish some basic design work (prototype and database). Since the project is still in the beginning state and we are still dealing with some basic problem like some ensuring what our client really wants and studying some relevant programming techniques. Although we have outputs lots of documentation and some technical artefact like some professional graph which would definitely guide the future development work, what we deliver to client is just illusrate that the team is in our progress and would finish each item in time as our plan has listed, so that our client would clearly know that his project can be done well and in time.
## 2. Technical artefacts
1. Coding environment set up
We use java and relevant tenology to develop our website. Since most of the team members are still learning java web development, we decide use the basic JSP + Servlet techniques to develop our website and use the other advanced framework like Spring MVC in the future to optimize our code. So we set up one most basic coding package for our development which has already been seen in this repository.
2. Database Design -- ER diagram and DDL
During the week 3 - 4, we spent our weekly meeting time to discuss about the structure of the database of our system. Since the system has lots of roles of users, we spent much energy to figure out the relationship between each of those. Finally, we came up with the [ER diagram](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1g7MCTPH4SlfDd-jZO8KmHQRD2yHxaGJi) and the [DDL](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W4d1lYUqAocgBWZjAKJz6IAubUzfs7Va) to set up our database environment. This slides show how we run our discussion: [slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aMd22UqM3z40_6MKiBZnILnb2l_NT9hs)

## 1. Project-Purpose
The purpose of this project is to change the existing static ANU basketball website to a dynamic website which can automatically generate the competition information. 

Currently the ANU basketball club uses google sheets for its team lists, draw, and results. The club wants to move beyond this system to a more professional, intuitive, automated system, that has a fantastic display on all screen sizes.

Building up a dynamic website, which shows team lists, draw and results, is the minimal requirement. Upon completion of the minimum requirements, we will make further improvements to our products.



<br/><br/>
## 2. Stakeholders
Stakeholder: ANU Sport, ANU Basketball club
Expectations: 
   * The product should be a dynamic website including team lists, draw, and results which can be automacally generated.
   * The product shoud be easily maintained in the future.
   * The product should meet the requirements of safety and stability.
   * The product needs a good user experience. Here are some [user stories](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-XtHVo89-OzaVYDgaL1F7XTA3fAdNQBD2rQPN3RXDwA).

<br/><br/>

## 3. How our Project will Make Things Better to Clients
1. We are using agile methodology. Every Thursday, we hold a meeting at law library from 5pm to 7pm. During the meeting, we talk about what we have done, what we need to do in next week and what difficulty we have. The client is also our team leader so it is easy for us to keep in touch with the client. Here is our [meeting minute](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ekg1O5Acb_g2y87SDB_Z-pxx__NzhAZZ).


2. Each sprint will last 1 week and we divide this process into four parts: Sprint planning, Sprint, review and retrospective. During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces. In each sprint, the team focuse on its goal and the sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.


3. We use Scrum Board in Trello and we have some scrum board lists:
   * Backlog: keep the Backlog of tasks to be worked on. When the client tells us he has something he needs help with, we add it to Backlog list.
   * To Do: When planing our Sprint, the team pull tasks from the Backlog to this list. This is the current Sprint the team is working on.
   * Doing: When a task has been started, it gets moved to ‘Doing’.
   * Done: Passed quality check, ready to be shipped! No more edits or reviews necessary, it’s scheduled and ready for action.
   * Blocked: When something is preventing the team from completing a task (maybe we need to purchase something first), we move it to “Blocked”, along with a comment about what the blocker is.
   
    Every team member can move the card in Scrum Board. For example, when someone starts a task in ‘To Do’ list, he can move this card from ‘To Do’ to ‘Doing’.


4. Teams meet (online or in person) every day to give progress updates in the Daily Scrum. We have a Scrum Master who asks 3 questions on Slack everyday:
   * What did you do today? 
   * What will you do tomorrow? 
   * Are there any impediments in your way?
   
   Every team member answer these 3 questions before 9pm everyday. If any team member has impediments, we will help him out. You can see it [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1p2Q9mtxwZO3g238WM5569rceUY5auysUqejwh20k_4M).

## 6. Resources, Risks and Costs
The main resources we required so far are all kinds of learning tutorial of Java Spring and some other learning tutorial on developing website. This is easy to find via the internet, for example Youtube. Besides, some team member has some relevant experience on doing website, which can also be very helpful for managing those learning resources and make the team be familar with the development technologies as soon as possible. Here is our [resource document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-VoXn1IPGSrPytOsw-ly2gAWar1iFFfgd6GUr93uxa0).

The main risks on doing this project is that neither the client nor we have the server or other online cloud services to deploy our project. The development team and our client are still seeking for possible solutions on deploying the final dynamic website. So far, we could only use some VPS which privately belong to the team member for doing some basic test. However, finding and getting familiar with one suitable platform which can hold the website for a long time is still one long term mission to accomplish. Once we decide which server to use, the cost of the server may be the main cost of our project.

## 7. Decision Making
Every team member was involved in decision making. We made decisions in meetings or online (like in Slack, in Wechat, and doodle poll). We have created a Decision Making File and there is the link below:
