## 1. Project-Purpose
The purpose of this project is to change the existing static ANU basketball website to a dynamic website which can automatically generate the competition information. 

Currently the ANU basketball club uses google sheets for its team lists, draw, and results. The club wants to move beyond this system to a more professional, intuitive, automated system, that has a fantastic display on all screen sizes.

Building up a dynamic website, which shows team lists, draw and results, is the minimal requirement. Upon completion of the minimum requirements, we will make further improvements to our products.

## 3. How our Project will Make Things Better to Clients
1. We are using agile methodology. Every Thursday, we hold a meeting at law library from 5pm to 7pm. During the meeting, we talk about what we have done, what we need to do in next week and what difficulty we have. The client is also our team leader so it is easy for us to keep in touch with the client.


2. Each sprint will last 1 week and we divide this process into four parts: Sprint planning, Sprint, review and retrospective. During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces. In each sprint, the team focuse on its goal and the sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.


3. We use Scrum Board in Trello and we have some scrum board lists:
   * Backlog: keep the Backlog of tasks to be worked on. When the client tells us he has something he needs help with, we add it to Backlog list.
   * To Do: When planing our Sprint, the team pull tasks from the Backlog to this list. This is the current Sprint the team is working on.
   * Doing: When a task has been started, it gets moved to ‘Doing’.
   * Done: Passed quality check, ready to be shipped! No more edits or reviews necessary, it’s scheduled and ready for action.
   * Blocked: When something is preventing the team from completing a task (maybe we need to purchase something first), we move it to “Blocked”, along with a comment about what the blocker is.
   
    Every team member can move the card in Scrum Board. For example, when someone starts a task in ‘To Do’ list, he can move this card from ‘To Do’ to ‘Doing’.


4. Teams meet (online or in person) every day to give progress updates in the Daily Scrum. We have a Scrum Master who asks 3 questions on Slack everyday:
   * What did you do today? 
   * What will you do tomorrow? 
   * Are there any impediments in your way?
   
   Every team member answer these 3 questions before 9pm everyday. If any team member has impediments, we will help him out. You can see it [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1p2Q9mtxwZO3g238WM5569rceUY5auysUqejwh20k_4M).
